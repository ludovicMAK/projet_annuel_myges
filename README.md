## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Docker & Docker Compose v2
- [Infisical CLI](https://infisical.com/docs/cli/overview) (`brew install infisical/get-cli/infisical`)

## Infisical

All secrets (dev and prod) are managed through Infisical — there is no `.env.example` to copy manually.

### How it works

- **Dev** — the CLI is used to manually pull secrets into a local `.env` file (gitignored) when needed
- **Prod** — the [Infisical Kubernetes operator](https://infisical.com/docs/integrations/platforms/kubernetes) syncs secrets directly into Kubernetes `Secret` objects at runtime

Secrets are organized by path in the `dev` / `prod` environments:

| Infisical path | Used by          |
|----------------|------------------|
| `/`            | General / shared |
| `/frontend`    | Frontend         |
| `/backend`     | Backend          |
| `/postgres`    | PostgreSQL       |

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Install the CLI
brew install infisical/get-cli/infisical

# 2. Log in
infisical login
```

## Running the project

### Generate the .env

```bash
# Pull dev secrets into .env (re-run whenever secrets change)
bash scripts/export-dev-env.sh
```

> `.env` is gitignored — never commit it.

### Without Docker

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start backend
npm run dev:express

# Start frontend
npm run dev:next
```

### With Docker (recommended)

```bash
# Start dev environment (hot-reload)
docker compose up

# Services available at:
#   Frontend  → http://localhost:3000
#   Backend   → http://localhost:3001
#   postgres  → localhost:5432
```

### Adding a dependency

The project mounts the root directory into containers (`.:/app`), but `node_modules` lives in a **named Docker volume** (`node_modules_backend`, `node_modules_frontend`). That volume takes precedence over the host's `node_modules` — the two are fully independent.

Running `npm install <pkg>` on the host updates `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, but the running container never sees it.

#### Correct workflow

```bash
# 1. Install locally to update package.json + package-lock.json
npm install <pkg> --workspace=@myges/express   # or @myges/next for the frontend

# 2. Install inside the running container to update its named volume
docker compose exec backend npm install   # or frontend
```

**Step 1** only updates `package.json` and `package-lock.json` on the host — these are tracked by git, so every team member gets the dependency when they pull.

**Step 2** installs the package inside the running container, writing into the named volume.
The volume persists across restarts (`docker compose down` / `up`), so the dependency stays available without reinstalling. Hot-reload picks up the change automatically.

> **Only doing step 1 :** `package.json` is up to date but the container doesn't have the package, your code will crash on import.
>
> **Only doing step 2 :** the package works in your container but `package.json` is not updated — the next person to clone the repo won't have it.

> **Why not 'docker compose up --build' ?**
> Rebuilding the image does re-run `npm ci` in the Dockerfile, but the existing named volume mounts over the image's `node_modules` at startup, so the rebuild has no effect as long as the volume exists.

## Production (Kubernetes)

Production runs on Kubernetes. Images are published to GHCR and secrets are injected at runtime by the Infisical operator.

### Architecture

```
Traefik ingress
├── myges.local      → frontend (namespace: frontend, 3 replicas)
└── api.myges.local  → backend  (namespace: backend,  2 replicas)
                           ↓
                        postgres (namespace: postgres, 1 replica + 5Gi PVC)
```

### CI/CD pipeline

```
push to develop       push to main
pull_request               │
      │                    │
      ▼                    ▼
 CI (ubuntu-latest, matrix: [backend, frontend])
      │                    │
 build only          build + push to GHCR
                           │
                           ▼
                     CD (self-hosted runner)
                       → kubectl apply -R -f k8s/
                       → rollout status (timeout: 60s)
                       → on failure: kubectl rollout undo
```

### CI/CD triggers

| Event | Branch | CI | CD |
|-------|--------|----|----|
| `push` | `main` | build + push to GHCR | deploy (if CI success) |
| `push` | `develop` | build only | not triggered |
| `pull_request` | any | build only | not triggered |

### Build platform

By default, Docker images are built for `linux/amd64`.
Set the `BUILD_PLATFORM` repository variable (**Settings → Variables → Actions**) to `linux/arm64` when deploying to an ARM-based environment such as Apple Silicon or AWS Graviton.

### Docker layer cache

GHA layer cache (`cache-from/cache-to: type=gha`) persists Docker build layers between CI runs so unchanged layers are reused instead of rebuilt. To make it effective on this project:
- Each Dockerfile copies `package*.json` before the rest of the source so the `npm ci` layer is only invalidated when dependencies actually change, not on every source edit.
- `mode=max` is set in the CI so GHA also caches the `builder` stage layers, without it, only the final `prod` stage is cached and the `builder` stage (where `npm ci` runs) is discarded after every build.

### Image versioning

| Image | Registry |
|-------|----------|
| Backend  | `ghcr.io/aztymatt/myges-backend:<tag>`  |
| Frontend | `ghcr.io/aztymatt/myges-frontend:<tag>` |

If a deployment introduces a regression or a critical bug, **revert the offending commit**.
The CI/CD pipeline will rebuild and redeploy the previous image automatically:

```bash
git revert <commit>
git push
```

### Secrets injection

The CD pipeline creates a Kubernetes `Secret` `<service>-infisical-auth` from GitHub Actions secrets, containing the service token for each service. The Infisical operator uses that token (declared in `k8s/<service>/infisical-secret.yml`) to fetch the service's secrets from Infisical and syncs them into `<service>-generated-secrets` (e.g. `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`), which pods consume via `envFrom`.

### Deployment strategies

**Backend & frontend — RollingUpdate:**

```yaml
strategy:
  rollingUpdate:
    maxSurge: 2
    maxUnavailable: 1
```

A rolling update replaces pods gradually.
By default K8s replaces them one at a time, `maxSurge: 2` makes it create 2 new pods simultaneously instead of 1, cutting rollout time roughly in half while keeping at least 1 pod serving traffic throughout (`maxUnavailable: 1`).

**Postgres — Recreate:**

```yaml
strategy:
  type: Recreate
```

Postgres cannot have two instances writing to the same PVC at the same time. `Recreate` kills the old pod first, then creates the new one, it avoids volume corruption at the cost of ~5-10s of DB downtime per deploy.

### Health probes

**readinessProbe** — gates traffic. K8s waits for this to pass before routing requests to a new pod and before taking down the old one during a rolling update. Failure removes the pod from rotation but does **not** restart it.

**livenessProbe** — detects zombie state (process alive but app deadlocked / event loop blocked / DB pool exhausted). Failure **restarts** the container. `initialDelaySeconds` is set higher than readiness to avoid restart loops during startup.

### Automatic rollback

The CD waits for the rollout to complete (`kubectl rollout status --timeout=60s`). If it times out (meaning new pods never passed readiness), the pipeline fails and automatically runs `kubectl rollout undo`, which reactivates the previous ReplicaSet without any rebuild.
